"""Vault brief: the deterministic "state of the vault" aggregate.

One emit-once source for the doc-side vault facts an agent otherwise re-derives
every session — recent changes, docs overdue for review, and inbox backlog —
so the `brief` shell tool can compose them with repo and writeup state in a
single cheap read instead of inferring from raw files.

FastMCP-free (the service spine): the same code backs both the MCP and the CLI.
Writeup state keeps its own owner (`writeup_service` / `list-writeups`); this
stays doc-focused so each fact has exactly one owner.
